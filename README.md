Mar 1 2025 - ready to merge update branch to master for deployment

Feb 19 2025 - had an issue with my push, got ```error: RPC failed; HTTP 400 curl 22 The requested URL returned error: 400 fatal: the remote end hung up unexpectedly```

Fixed it with the command ```git config --global http.postBuffer 157286400``` by increasing the size of my commit.
